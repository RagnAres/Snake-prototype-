# Snake-prototype-
snake game prototype using LibGDX.

Prototype of a snake game using LibGDX (wiki page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibGDX). This prototype shows three square blocks that move using the keyboard arrow keys (two blocks follow a head block).

This is not a fully playable game. It is only intended for movement and/or animation testing. Screen size is 400x400. No wall collisions (snake "teleports" to opposite side). A red square block (apple) spawns too and will respawn when the snake "eats" it.

Beind developed on Android Studio.
